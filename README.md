# DIY Smartwatch PCB  
This is a **custom smartwatch PCB** I designed for fun and educational purposes.  
The goal of the project was to learn more about PCB design, power management, and electronic in general.

⚠️ **Disclaimer:**  
This project is experimental and not intended for commercial use.  
I cannot guarantee safety, reliability, or fitness for any application — use it at your own risk.  
The schematics are not guaranteed to work perfectly, after all this is my first PCB design.
